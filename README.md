# CSE 194 Project

We plan to research the differences between what students expect in grades from professors who identify as a man versus professors who identify as a woman. Using information from platforms like CAPES at UC San Diego, we want to collect data on student average grade expected versus average grade received versus whether the student would recommend the professor. This research project will either identify any evidence that students have biases (whether implicit or explicit) against women professors in their expectations of grades or that there is no difference between the expectations of students for men and women professors. Ultimately, we would like to evaluate whether there are possibly more biases against women professors teaching in fields where they are historically underrepresented.
